# A Living Review of Quantum Computing for Plasma Physics

The purpose of this note is to collect references for quantum algorithms already relevant to plasma physics.  A minimal number of categories is chosen in order to be as useful as possible. Note that papers may be referenced in more than one category.

The Living Review is hosted as a [Github project](https://github.com/QPPQLivingReview/review). It can be consulted either as a:
* [Markdown/HTML webpage](https://qppqlivingreview.github.io/review/), where the URL links for each reference are available;
* [LaTeX PDF file](https://qppqlivingreview.github.io/review/review/review.pdf), which is also downloadable directly from the webpage.

The fact that a paper is listed in this document does not endorse or validate its content - that is for the community (and for peer-review) to decide.  Furthermore, the classification here is a best attempt and may have flaws - please let us know if (a) we have missed a paper you think should be included, (b) a paper has been misclassified or wrongly tagged, or (c) a citation for a paper is not correct or if the journal information is now available.

In order to be as useful as possible, this document will continue to evolve so please check back before you write your next paper. You can simply download the .bib file to get all of the latest references.
