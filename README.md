#  **QPPQ**: *a living review of Quantum Computing + Plasma Physics*

<!DOCTYPE html><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/texme@1.2.2"></script><textarea>

*Quantum Computing promises accelerated simulation of certain classes of problems, in particular in plasma physics. The goal of this document is to provide a comprehensive list of citations for those developing and applying these approaches to experimental or theoretical analyses. As a living document, it will be updated as often as possible to incorporate the latest developments.  Suggestions are most welcome.*

The purpose of this note is to collect references for quantum algorithms already relevant to plasma physics.  A minimal number of categories is chosen in order to be as useful as possible. Note that papers may be referenced in more than one category.

To facilitate search, if clearly appropriate, the following tags are applied 

* [![download](https://img.shields.io/badge/-NISQ-limegreen.svg)]() __noisy-intermediate scale quantum computing__

* [![download](https://img.shields.io/badge/-FTol-red)]() __fault-tolerant quantum computing__

* [![download](https://img.shields.io/badge/-QAnn-blue)]() __quantum annealing__

* [![download](https://img.shields.io/badge/-QIns-grey)]() __quantum-inspired__

Color-filled tags indicate the type of content. Since most papers contain some form of theoretical analysis, we use

* [![download](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Theo-darkred)]() __theoretical__ tag solely for the papers with analytical results, and no considerable numerical or experimental results

* [![download](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Num-darkblue)]() marks papers with __numerical simulations__, but no experimental results run on quantum devices.

* [![download](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Exp-darkgreen)]() marks papers with displayed __experimental__ results. We may ommit this tag if the paper is referenced and tagged in a subsequent subsection.

The inclusion of a paper in the review does not indicate endorsement or validation of its content, as this is to be determined by the community and through peer review. The classification system may have limitations and we welcome feedback from the community on any papers that should be included, papers that have been misclassified or errors in citations or journal information.

In order to be as useful as possible, this document will continue to evolve so please check back. See [http://epp.ist.utl.pt/qppq/](http://epp.ist.utl.pt/qppq/) before you write your next paper. You can simply download the **.bib** file to get all of the latest references. Please consider citing Ref. **\cite{qppqlivingreview}** when referring to this living review.
