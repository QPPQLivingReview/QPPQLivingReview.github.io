  abstract = {In this work, we obtain the numerical temperature field to a thermally developing fluid flow inside parallel plates problem with a quantum computing method. The physical problem deals with the heat transfer of a steady state, hydrodinamically developed and thermally developing fluid flow inside two parallel plates channel subjected to a prescribed constant heat flux. Its solution is formulated numerically with Finite Differences method, where a sequence of linear systems must be solved in order to determine the complete temperature field. Such linear systems are written as discrete unconstrained optimization problems with floating points being approximated using binary variables and solved using near-term quantum heuristics. Due to the exponential cost of simulating quantum algorithms, a reduced number of qubits had to be used in the simulations, causing a loss of precision in the results. However, this work advances the state of the art of solutions of differential equations with noisy quantum devices and could be used for useful applications when quantum computers with thousands of qubits become available.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in quantum computing and their increased availability has led to a growing interest in possible applications. Among those is the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) for, e.g., material or flow simulation. Currently, the most promising route to useful deployment of quantum processors in the short to near term are so-called hybrid variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). Thus, variational methods for PDEs have been proposed as a candidate for quantum advantage in the noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era. In this work, we conduct an extensive study of utilizing VQAs on real quantum devices to solve the simplest prototype of a PDE -- the Poisson equation. Although results on noiseless simulators for small problem sizes may seem deceivingly promising, the performance on quantum computers is very poor. We argue that direct resolution of PDEs via an amplitude encoding of the solution is not a good use case within reach of today's quantum devices -- especially when considering large system sizes and more complicated non-linear PDEs that are required in order to be competitive with classical high-end solvers.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear differential equations exhibit rich phenomena in many fields but are notoriously challenging to solve. Recently, Liu et al. [1] demonstrated the first efficient quantum algorithm for dissipative quadratic differential equations under the condition \$R \&lt; 1\$, where \$R\$ measures the ratio of nonlinearity to dissipation using the \$\textbackslash ell\_2\$ norm. Here we develop an efficient quantum algorithm based on [1] for reaction-diffusion equations, a class of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). To achieve this, we improve upon the Carleman linearization approach introduced in [1] to obtain a faster convergence rate under the condition \$R\_D \&lt; 1\$, where \$R\_D\$ measures the ratio of nonlinearity to dissipation using the \$\textbackslash ell\_\{\textbackslash infty\}\$ norm. Since \$R\_D\$ is independent of the number of spatial grid points \$n\$ while \$R\$ increases with \$n\$, the criterion \$R\_D\&lt;1\$ is significantly milder than \$R\&lt;1\$ for high-dimensional systems and can stay convergent under grid refinement for approximating PDEs. As applications of our quantum algorithm we consider the Fisher-KPP and Allen-Cahn equations, which have interpretations in classical physics. In particular, we show how to estimate the mean square kinetic energy in the solution by postprocessing the quantum state that encodes it to extract derivative information.},

Previous algorithms had optimal or near-optimal scaling in some parameters at the cost of poor scaling in others. Hamiltonian simulation via a quantum walk has optimal dependence on the sparsity at the expense of poor scaling in the allowed error. In contrast, an approach based on fractional-query simulation provides optimal scaling in the error at the expense of poor scaling in the sparsity. Here we combine the two approaches, achieving the best features of both. By implementing a linear combination of quantum walk steps with coefficients given by Bessel functions, our algorithm's complexity (as measured by the number of queries and 2-qubit gates) is logarithmic in the inverse error, and nearly linear in the product \$\textbackslash tau\$ of the evolution time, the sparsity, and the magnitude of the largest entry of the Hamiltonian. Our dependence on the error is optimal, and we prove a new lower bound showing that no algorithm can have sublinear dependence on \$\textbackslash tau\$.},

In this work, we focus on the viability of using quantum annealing for solving these problems. We use simulations based on the adiabatic principle to provide new insights for previously observed phenomena with the D-wave machines, such as quantum annealing being robust against ill-conditioned systems of equations and scaling quite well against the number of rows in a system. We then propose a hybrid approach which uses a quantum annealer to provide a initial guess of the solution \$x\_0\$, which would then be iteratively improved with classical fixed point iteration methods.},

Here, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, called Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS), for solving linear systems on near-term quantum computers. VQLS seeks to variationally prepare \$|x\textbackslash rangle\$ such that \$A|x\textbackslash rangle\textbackslash propto|b\textbackslash rangle\$. We derive an operationally meaningful termination condition for VQLS that allows one to guarantee that a desired solution precision \$\textbackslash epsilon\$ is achieved. Specifically, we prove that \$C \textbackslash geq \textbackslash epsilon\^2 / \textbackslash kappa\^2\$, where \$C\$ is the VQLS cost function and \$\textbackslash kappa\$ is the condition number of \$A\$. We present efficient quantum circuits to estimate \$C\$, while providing evidence for the classical hardness of its estimation. Using Rigetti's quantum computer, we successfully implement VQLS up to a problem size of \$1024\textbackslash times1024\$. Finally, we numerically solve non-trivial problems of size up to \$2\^\{50\}\textbackslash times2\^\{50\}\$. For the specific examples that we consider, we heuristically find that the time complexity of VQLS scales efficiently in \$\textbackslash epsilon\$, \$\textbackslash kappa\$, and the system size \$N\$.},

We present a direct method for solving general systems of polynomial equations based on quantum annealing, and we validate this method using a system of second-order polynomial equations solved on a commercially available quantum annealer. We then demonstrate applications for linear regression, and discuss in more detail the scaling behavior for general systems of linear equations with respect to problem size, condition number, and search precision.

Recently we proposed an efficient quantum algorithm for solving one-dimensional Poisson equation avoiding the need to perform quantum arithmetic or Hamiltonian simulation. In this paper, we further develop this algorithm to make it closer to the real application on the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. To this end, we first optimize the quantum 1D-Poisson solver by developing a new way of performing the sine transformation. The circuit depth for implementing the sine transform is reduced from n2 to n without increasing the total qubit cost of the whole circuit, which is achieved by neatly reusing the additional ancillary quits. Then, we analyse the effect of common noise existing in the real quantum devices on our algorithm using the IBM Qiskit toolkit. We find that the phase damping noise has little effect on our algorithm, while the bit flip noise has the greatest impact. In addition, threshold errors of the quantum gates are obtained to make the fidelity of the circuit output being greater than 90\%. The results of noise analysis will provide a good guidance for the subsequent work of error mitigation and error correction for our algorithm. The noise-analysis method developed in this work can be used for other algorithms to be executed on the NISQ devices.}

  abstract = {Quantum computing is gaining increased attention as a potential way to speed up simulations of physical systems, and it is also of interest to apply it to simulations of classical plasmas. However, quantum information science is traditionally aimed at modeling linear Hamiltonian systems of a particular form that is found in quantum mechanics, so extending the existing results to plasma applications remains a challenge. Here, we report a preliminary exploration of the long-term opportunities and likely obstacles in this area. First, we show that many plasma-wave problems are naturally representable in a quantumlike form and thus are naturally fit for quantum computers. Second, we consider more general plasma problems that include non-Hermitian dynamics (instabilities, irreversible dissipation) and nonlinearities. We show that by extending the configuration space, such systems can also be represented in a quantumlike form and thus can be simulated with quantum computers too, albeit that requires more computational resources compared to the first case. Third, we outline potential applications of hybrid quantum\textendash classical computers, which include analysis of global eigenmodes and also an alternative approach to nonlinear simulations.}

Here, we propose how to compute a general differentiable invertible nonlinear map on a quantum computer using only linear unitary operations. The price of this universality is that the original map is represented adequately only on a finite number of iterations. More iterations produce spurious echos, which are unavoidable in any finite unitary emulation of generic non-conservative dynamics. Our work is intended as the first survey of these issues and possible ways to overcome them in the future. We propose how to monitor spurious echos via auxiliary measurements, and we illustrate our results with numerical simulations.},

Such systems are important in both fluid and kinetic computational plasma physics. This motivates exploring whether a future error-corrected quantum computer could perform these simulations more efficiently than any classical computer. We describe a method for mapping any finite nonlinear dynamical system to an infinite linear dynamical system (embedding) and detail three specific cases of this method that correspond to previously studied mappings. Then we explore an approach for approximating the resulting infinite linear system with finite linear systems (truncation). Using a number of qubits only logarithmic in the number of variables of the nonlinear system, a quantum computer could simulate truncated systems to approximate output quantities if the nonlinearity is sufficiently weak. Other aspects of the computational efficiency of the three detailed embedding strategies are also discussed.}

Then for the limiting case of electrostatic Landau damping, we design and verify a quantum algorithm, appropriate for a future error-corrected universal quantum computer. While the classical simulation has costs that scale as O(Nvt) for a velocity grid with Nv grid points and simulation time t, our quantum algorithm scales as O[polylog(Nv)t/{$\delta$}] where {$\delta$} is the measurement error, and weaker scalings have been dropped. Extensions, including electromagnetics and higher dimensions, are discussed. A quantum computer could efficiently handle a high-resolution, six-dimensional phase-space grid, but the 1/{$\delta$} cost factor to extract an accurate result remains a difficulty.

  abstract = {The time-marching strategy, which propagates the solution from one time step to the next, is a natural strategy for solving time-dependent differential equations on classical computers, as well as for solving the Hamiltonian simulation problem on quantum computers. For more general linear differential equations, a time-marching based quantum solver can suffer from exponentially vanishing success probability with respect to the number of time steps and is thus considered impractical. We solve this problem by repeatedly invoking a technique called the uniform singular value amplification, and the overall success probability can be lower bounded by a quantity that is independent of the number of time steps. The success probability can be further improved using a compression gadget lemma. This provides a path of designing quantum differential equation solvers that is alternative to those based on quantum linear systems algorithms (QLSA). We demonstrate the performance of the time-marching strategy with a high-order integrator based on the truncated Dyson series. The complexity of the algorithm depends linearly on the amplification ratio, which quantifies the deviation from a unitary dynamics. We prove that the linear dependence on the amplification ratio attains the query complexity lower bound and thus cannot be improved in general. This algorithm also surpasses existing QLSA based solvers in three aspects: (1) the coefficient matrix \$A(t)\$ does not need to be diagonalizable. (2) \$A(t)\$ can be non-smooth, and is only of bounded variation. (3) It can use fewer queries to the initial state. Finally, we demonstrate the time-marching strategy with a first-order truncated Magnus series, while retaining the aforementioned benefits. Our analysis also raises some open questions concerning the differences between time-marching and QLSA based methods for solving differential equations.},

The reservoir technique is a method designed to avoid artificial diffusion generated by first-order finite volume methods approximating hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. For some class of hyperbolic systems, namely, those with constant matrices in several dimensions, we show that the combination of (i) the reservoir method and (ii) the alternate direction iteration operator splitting approximation allows for the derivation of algorithms only based on simple unitary transformations, thus being perfectly suitable for an implementation on a quantum computer. The same approach can also be adapted to scalar one-dimensional systems with non-constant velocity by combining with a non-uniform mesh. The asymptotic computational complexity for the time evolution is determined and it is demonstrated that the quantum algorithm is more efficient than the classical version. However, in the quantum case, the solution is encoded in probability amplitudes of the quantum register. As a consequence, as with other similar quantum algorithms, a post-processing mechanism has to be used to obtain general properties of the solution because a direct reading cannot be performed as efficiently as the time evolution.},

In this work, we study near-term quantum algorithms for linear systems of equations, with a focus on the two-norm and Tikhonov regression settings. We investigate the use of variational algorithms and analyze their optimization landscapes. There exist types of linear systems for which variational algorithms designed to avoid barren plateaus, such as properly-initialized imaginary time evolution and adiabatic-inspired optimization, suffer from a different plateau problem. To circumvent this issue, we design near-term algorithms based on a core idea: the classical combination of variational quantum states (CQS). We exhibit several provable guarantees for these algorithms, supported by the representation of the linear system on a so-called ansatz tree. The CQS approach and the ansatz tree also admit the systematic application of heuristic approaches, including a gradient-based search. We have conducted numerical experiments solving linear systems as large as 2300 \texttimes{} 2300 by considering cases where we can simulate the quantum algorithm efficiently on a classical computer.

This Schr\"odinger equation is linear in the momenta because it derives from a constrained Hamiltonian system with twice the classical phase-space dimension. A quantum computer with finite resources can be used to simulate a finite-dimensional approximation of this unitary evolution operator. Quantum simulation of classical dynamics is exponentially more efficient than a deterministic Eulerian discretization of the Liouville equation if the Koopman\textendash von Neumann Hamiltonian is sparse.

  abstract = {This is a review of recent research exploring and extending present-day quantum computing capabilities for fusion energy science applications. We begin with a brief tutorial on both ideal and open quantum dynamics, universal quantum computation, and quantum algorithms. Then, we explore the topic of using quantum computers to simulate both linear and nonlinear dynamics in greater detail. Because quantum computers can only efficiently perform linear operations on the quantum state, it is challenging to perform nonlinear operations that are generically required to describe the nonlinear differential equations of interest. In this work, we extend previous results on embedding nonlinear systems within linear systems by explicitly deriving the connection between the Koopman evolution operator, the Perron-Frobenius evolution operator, and the Koopman-von Neumann evolution (KvN) operator. We also explicitly derive the connection between the Koopman and Carleman approaches to embedding. Extension of the KvN framework to the complex-analytic setting relevant to Carleman embedding, and the proof that different choices of complex analytic reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces depend on the choice of Hilbert space metric are covered in the appendices. Finally, we conclude with a review of recent quantum hardware implementations of algorithms on present-day quantum hardware platforms that may one day be accelerated through Hamiltonian simulation. We discuss the simulation of toy models of wave-particle interactions through the simulation of quantum maps and of wave-wave interactions important in nonlinear plasma dynamics.},

In contrast to other approaches, there is no a-priori introduction of the Riemann-Silberstein-Weber (RSW) vector but the Maxwell equations are considered in their standard fields, with given constitutive relations. From the electromagnetic conservation quantities a pseudo-Hermitian dynamics is found together with a Dyson map that recovers the full Hermicity of the dynamics in an extended Hilbert space that describes the physical notion of unitary evolution.

In Berry et al., (2017), a quantum algorithm for a certain class of linear ODEs is given, where the matrix involved needs to be diagonalizable. The quantum algorithm for linear ODEs presented here extends to many classes of non-diagonalizable matrices. The algorithm here can also be exponentially faster for certain classes of diagonalizable matrices. Our linear ODE algorithm is then applied to nonlinear differential equations using Carleman linearization (an approach taken recently by us in Liu et al., (2021)). The improvement over that result is two-fold. First, we obtain an exponentially better dependence on error. This kind of logarithmic dependence on error has also been achieved by Xue et al., (2021), but only for homogeneous nonlinear equations. Second, the present algorithm can handle any sparse, invertible matrix (that models dissipation) if it has a negative log-norm (including non-diagonalizable matrices), whereas Liu et al., (2021) and Xue et al., (2021) additionally require normality.},

  abstract = {Stochastic differential equations (SDE), which models uncertain phenomena as the time evolution of random variables, are exploited in various fields of natural and social sciences such as finance. Since SDEs rarely admit analytical solutions and must usually be solved numerically with huge classical-computational resources in practical applications, there is strong motivation to use quantum computation to accelerate the calculation. Here, we propose a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm that solves SDEs based on variational quantum simulation (VQS). We first approximate the target SDE by a trinomial tree structure with discretization and then formulate it as the time-evolution of a quantum state embedding the probability distributions of the SDE variables. We embed the probability distribution directly in the amplitudes of the quantum state while the previous studies did the square-root of the probability distribution in the amplitudes. Our embedding enables us to construct simple quantum circuits that simulate the time-evolution of the state for general SDEs. We also develop a scheme to compute the expectation values of the SDE variables and discuss whether our scheme can achieve quantum speed-up for the expectation-value evaluations of the SDE variables. Finally, we numerically validate our algorithm by simulating several types of stochastic processes. Our proposal provides a new direction for simulating SDEs on quantum computers.},

This work extends previous work by developing a non-linear hybrid quantum-classical CFD solver and using it to generate fully converged solutions. The hybrid solver uses the SIMPLE CFD algorithm, which is common in many industrial CFD codes, and applies it to the 2-dimensional lid driven cavity test case. A theme of this work is the classical processing time needed to prepare the quantum circuit with a focus on the decomposition of the CFD matrix into a linear combination of unitaries (LCU). CFD meshes with up to 65x65 nodes are considered with the largest producing a LCU containing 32,767 Pauli strings. A new method for rapidly re-computing the coefficients in a LCU is proposed, although this reduces, rather than eliminates, the classical scaling issues. The quantum linear equation solver uses the Harrow, Hassidim, Lloyd (HHL) algorithm via a state-vector emulator. Test matrices are sampled from the classical CFD solver to investigate the solution accuracy that can be achieved with HHL. For the smallest 5x5 and 9x9 CFD meshes, full non-linear hybrid CFD calculations are performed. The impacts of approximating the LCU and the varying the number of ancilla rotations in the eigenvalue inversion circuit are studied. Preliminary timing results indicate that the classical computer preparation time needed for a hybrid solver is just as important to the achievement of quantum advantage in CFD as the time on the quantum computer. The reported HHL solutions and LCU decompositions provide a benchmark for future research. The CFD test matrices used in this study are available upon request.},

As an increasingly active topic in QC, the variational quantum algorithm leads a promising tool for solving partial differential equations on noisy intermediate scale quantum devices. Although a clear perspective on the advantages of QC over classical computing techniques for specific mathematical and physical problems exists, applications of QC in computational fluid dynamics to solve practical flow problems, though promising, are still at the early stage of development. To explore QC in practical simulation of flow problems, this work applies a variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, namely the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS), to resolve the heat conduction equation through finite difference discretization of the Laplacian operator. Details of the VQLS implementation are discussed by various test instances of linear systems. The effect of the number of shots on the accuracy is studied, which reveals a logarithmic relationship. Furthermore, the heuristic scaling of the VQLS with the precision {$\epsilon$}, the number of qubits n and the condition number k validates its time complexity reported in the literature. In addition, the successful state vector simulations of the heat conduction equation in one and two dimensions demonstrate the validity of the present VQLS-based algorithm by proof-of-concept results. Finally, the heuristic scaling for the heat conduction problem indicates that the time complexity of the present approach is logarithmically dependent on the precision {$\epsilon$} and linearly dependent on the number of qubits n.}

While there has been extensive previous work on efficient quantum algorithms for linear differential equations, the linearity of quantum mechanics has limited analogous progress for the nonlinear case. Despite this obstacle, we develop a quantum algorithm for dissipative quadratic  {$\mathsl{n}$} n -dimensional ordinary differential equations. Assuming  R{$<$}1 R{$<$}1 , where  R R  is a parameter characterizing the ratio of the nonlinearity and forcing to the linear dissipation, this algorithm has complexity  {$\mathsl{T}$} 2 {$\mathsl{q}$}poly(log{$\mathsl{T}$},log{$\mathsl{n}$},log1/{$\in$})/{$\in$} T2q\,poly(log⁡T,log⁡n,log⁡1/{$\epsilon$})/{$\epsilon$} , where  {$\mathsl{T}$} T  is the evolution time,  {$\in$} {$\epsilon$}  is the allowed error, and  {$\mathsl{q}$} q  measures decay of the solution. This is an exponential improvement over the best previous quantum algorithms, whose complexity is exponential in  {$\mathsl{T}$} T . While exponential decay precludes efficiency, driven equations can avoid this issue despite the presence of dissipation. Our algorithm uses the method of Carleman linearization, for which we give a convergence theorem. This method maps a system of nonlinear differential equations to an infinite-dimensional system of linear differential equations, which we discretize, truncate, and solve using the forward Euler method and the quantum linear system algorithm. We also provide a lower bound on the worst-case complexity of quantum algorithms for general quadratic differential equations, showing that the problem is intractable for  R{$\geq$} 2 - {$\surd$} R{$\geq$}2 . Finally, we discuss potential applications, showing that the  R{$<$}1 R{$<$}1  condition can be satisfied in realistic epidemiological models and giving numerical evidence that the method may describe a model of fluid dynamics even for larger values of  R R .},

  abstract = {State-of-the-art cosmological simulations on classical computers are limited by time, energy, and memory usage. Quantum computers can perform some calculations exponentially faster than classical computers, using exponentially less energy and memory, and may enable extremely large simulations that accurately capture the whole dynamic range of structure in the universe within statistically representative cosmic volumes. However, not all computational tasks exhibit a ``quantum advantage.'' Quantum circuits act linearly on quantum states, so nonlinearities (e.g., self-gravity in cosmological simulations) pose a significant challenge. Here we outline one potential approach to overcome this challenge and solve the (nonlinear) Schr\"odinger\textendash Poisson equations for the evolution of self-gravitating dark matter, based on a hybrid quantum\textendash classical variational algorithm framework (Lubasch et al.). We demonstrate the method with a proof-of-concept mock quantum simulation, envisioning a future where quantum computers will one day lead simulations of dark matter.},

  abstract = {The finite element method is used to approximately solve boundary value problems for differential equations. The method discretizes the parameter space and finds an approximate solution by solving a large system of linear equations. Here we investigate the extent to which the finite element method can be accelerated using an efficient quantum algorithm for solving linear equations. We consider the representative general question of approximately computing a linear functional of the solution to a boundary value problem and compare the quantum algorithm's theoretical performance with that of a standard classical algorithm\textemdash the conjugate gradient method. Prior work claimed that the quantum algorithm could be exponentially faster but did not determine the overall classical and quantum run times required to achieve a predetermined solution accuracy. Taking this into account, we find that the quantum algorithm can achieve a polynomial speedup, the extent of which grows with the dimension of the partial differential equation. In addition, we give evidence that no improvement of the quantum algorithm can lead to a superpolynomial speedup when the dimension is fixed and the solution satisfies certain smoothness properties.}

However, such simulations can be sped up using quantum computers in the future. Here, we propose how to do such modeling for cold plasma waves, in particular, for an X wave propagating in an inhomogeneous one-dimensional plasma. The wave system is represented in the form of a vector Schr\"odinger equation with a Hermitian Hamiltonian. Block encoding is used to represent the Hamiltonian through unitary operations that can be implemented on a quantum computer. To perform the modeling, we apply the so-called quantum signal processing algorithm and construct the corresponding circuit. Quantum simulations with this circuit are emulated on a classical computer, and the results show agreement with traditional classical calculations. We also discuss how our quantum circuit scales with the resolution.}

  abstract = {Quantum algorithms for solving linear systems of equations have generated excitement because of the potential speed-ups involved and the importance of solving linear equations in many applications. However, applying these algorithms can be challenging. The Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm and improvements thereof require complex subroutines suitable for fault-tolerant hardware such as Hamiltonian simulation, making it ill-suited to current hardware. Variational algorithms, on the other hand, involve expensive optimization loops, which can be prone to barren plateaus and local optima. We describe a quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations that avoids these problems. Our algorithm is based on the Woodbury identity, which analytically describes the inverse of a matrix that is a low-rank modification of another (easily-invertible) matrix. This approach only utilizes basic quantum subroutines like the Hadamard test or the swap test, so it is well-suited to current hardware. There is no optimization loop, so barren plateaus and local optima do not present a problem. The low-rank aspect of the identity enables us to efficiently transfer information to and from the quantum computer. This approach can produce accurate results on current hardware. As evidence of this, we estimate an inner product involving the solution of a system of more than 16 million equations with 2\% error using IBM's Auckland quantum computer. To our knowledge, no system of equations this large has previously been solved to this level of accuracy on a quantum computer.},

Although reliable CFD results can be obtained with turbulence models, direct numerical simulation of complex bodies in three spatial dimensions (3D) is impracticable due to the massive amount of computational elements. For instance, a 3D direct numerical simulation of a turbulent boundary-layer over the wing of a commercial jetliner that resolves all relevant length scales using a serial CFD solver on a modern digital computer would take approximately 750~million years or roughly 20\% of the earth's age. Over the past 25 years, quantum computers have become the object of great interest worldwide as powerful quantum algorithms have been constructed for several important, computationally challenging problems that provide enormous speed-up over the best-known classical algorithms. In this paper, we adapt a recently introduced quantum algorithm for partial differential equations to Burgers' equation and develop a quantum CFD solver that determines its solutions. We used our quantum CFD solver to verify the quantum Burgers' equation algorithm to find the flow solution when a shockwave is and is not present. The quantum simulation results were compared to: (i) an exact analytical solution for a flow without a shockwave; and (ii) the results of a classical CFD solver for flows with and without a shockwave. Excellent agreement was found in both cases, and the error of the quantum CFD solver was comparable to that of the classical CFD solver.},

To tackle these shortcomings, we implement Tensor Neural Networks (TNN), a quantum-inspired neural network architecture that leverages Tensor Network ideas to improve upon deep learning approaches. We demonstrate that TNN provide significant parameter savings while attaining the same accuracy as compared to the classical Dense Neural Network (DNN). In addition, we also show how TNN can be trained faster than DNN for the same accuracy. We benchmark TNN by applying them to solve parabolic PDEs, specifically the Black-Scholes-Barenblatt equation, widely used in financial pricing theory, empirically showing the advantages of TNN over DNN. Further examples, such as the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, are also discussed.},

  abstract = {There is considerable interest in the application of quantum information science to advance computations in plasma physics. A particular point~of curiosity is whether it is possible to take advantage of quantum computers to speed up numerical simulations relative to conventional computers. Many of the topics in fusion plasma physics are classical in nature. In order to implement them on quantum computers, it will require couching a classical problem in the language of quantum mechanics. Electromagnetic waves are routinely used in fusion experiments to heat a plasma or to generate currents in the plasma. The propagation of electromagnetic waves is described by Maxwell equations with an appropriate description of the plasma as a dielectric medium. Before advancing to the tensor dielectric of a magnetized plasma, this paper considers electromagnetic wave propagation in a one-dimensional inhomogeneous scalar dielectric. The classic theory of scattering of plane electromagnetic waves at a planar interface, separating two different dielectric media, leads to Fresnel equations for reflection and transmission coefficients. In contrast to plane waves, this paper is on the reflection and transmission of a spatially confined electromagnetic pulse. Following an analytical formulation for the scattering of a Gaussian pulse, it is deduced that the maximum transmission coefficient for a pulse is  {$\mathsl{n}$} 2 / {$\mathsl{n}$} 1 - - - - - {$\surd$} n2/n1  times that for a plane wave; the incident and transmitted pulses propagate in dielectric media with refractive indices n1 and n2, respectively. The analytical theory is complemented by numerical simulations using a quantum lattice algorithm for Maxwell equations. The algorithm, based on the Riemann\textendash Silberstein\textendash Weber representation of the electromagnetic fields and expressed in terms of qubits, is an interleaved sequence of entangling operators at each lattice site and unitary streaming operators, which transmit information from one site to an adjacent lattice site. Besides substantiating results from the theory for Gaussian pulses, numerical simulations show their validity for non-Gaussian pulses. Apart from their time-asymptotic forms, the simulations display an interplay between the incident, reflected, and transmitted pulses in the vicinity of the transition region between two dielectric media.}

Most quantum algorithms for the Poisson solver presented so far either suffer from lack of accuracy and/or are limited to very small sizes of the problem, and thus have no practical usage. Here we present an advanced quantum algorithm for solving the Poisson equation with high accuracy and dynamically tunable problem size. After converting the Poisson equation to a linear system through the finite difference method, we adopt the HHL algorithm as the basic framework. Particularly, in this work we present an advanced circuit that ensures the accuracy of the solution by implementing non-truncated eigenvalues through eigenvalue amplification, as well as by increasing the accuracy of the controlled rotation angular coefficients, which are the critical factors in the HHL algorithm. Consequently, we are able to drastically reduce the relative error in the solution while achieving higher success probability as the amplification level is increased. We show that our algorithm not only increases the accuracy of the solutions but also composes more practical and scalable circuits by dynamically controlling problem size in NISQ devices. We present both simulated and experimental results and discuss the sources of errors. Finally, we conclude that though overall results on the existing NISQ hardware are dominated by the error in the CNOT gates, this work opens a path to realizing a multidimensional Poisson solver on near-term quantum hardware.},

Moreover, on noisy devices without error correction, we show that simulation results are significantly improved when the quantum program is compiled using modular gates instead of a restricted set of standard gates. We demonstrate the general methodology by solving a cubic interaction problem, which appears in nonlinear optics, gauge theories, as well as plasma and fluid dynamics. To encode the non-native Hamiltonian evolution, we decompose the Hilbert space into a direct sum of invariant subspaces in which the nonlinear problem is mapped to a finite-dimensional Hamiltonian simulation problem. In a three-states example, the resultant unitary evolution is realized by a product of approximately 20 standard gates, using which approximately ten simulation steps can be carried out on state-of-the-art quantum hardware before results are corrupted by decoherence. In comparison, the simulation depth is improved by more than an order of magnitude when the unitary evolution is realized as a single cubic gate, which is compiled directly using optimal control. Alternatively, parametric gates may also be compiled by interpolating control pulses. Modular gates thus obtained provide high-fidelity building blocks for quantum Hamiltonian simulations.}

As a toy model, we study scalar QED, which describes self-consistent interactions between charged bosons and electromagnetic fields. To solve this model on a computer, we first discretize the scalar-QED action on a lattice, in a way that respects geometric structures of exterior calculus and U(1)-gauge symmetry. The lattice scalar QED can then be solved, in the classical-statistics regime, by advancing an ensemble of statistically equivalent initial conditions in time, using classical field equations obtained by extremizing the discrete action. To demonstrate the capability of our numerical scheme, we apply it to two example problems. The first example is the propagation of linear waves, where we recover analytic wave dispersion relations using numerical spectrum. The second example is an intense laser interacting with a one-dimensional plasma slab, where we demonstrate natural transition from wakefield acceleration to pair production when the wave amplitude exceeds the Schwinger threshold. Our real-time lattice scheme is fully explicit and respects local conservation laws, making it reliable for long-time dynamics. The algorithm is readily parallelized using domain decomposition, and the ensemble may be computed using quantum parallelism in the future.}

  abstract = {In the last few years, several quantum algorithms that try to address the problem of partial differential equation solving have been devised: on the one hand, ``direct'' quantum algorithms that aim at encoding the solution of the PDE by executing one large quantum circuit; on the other hand, variational algorithms that approximate the solution of the PDE by executing several small quantum circuits and making profit of classical optimisers. In this work, we propose an experimental study of the costs (in terms of gate number and execution time on a idealised hardware created from realistic gate data) associated with one of the ``direct'' quantum algorithm: the wave equation solver devised in [32]. We show that our implementation of the quantum wave equation solver agrees with the theoretical big-O complexity of the algorithm. We also explain in great detail the implementation steps and discuss some possibilities of improvements. Finally, our implementation proves experimentally that some PDE can be solved on a quantum computer, even if the direct quantum algorithm chosen will require error-corrected quantum chips, which are not believed to be available in the short-term.},

The time complexities of our algorithms are O({$\kappa$}2log({$\kappa$})/{$\epsilon$}) and O({$\kappa$}log({$\kappa$})/{$\epsilon$}), where {$\kappa$} is the condition number of A and {$\epsilon$} is the precision. Both algorithms are constructed using families of Hamiltonians that are linear combinations of products of A, the projector onto the initial state |b{$\rangle$}, and single-qubit Pauli operators. The algorithms are conceptually simple and easy to implement. They are not obtained from equivalences between the gate model and adiabatic quantum computing. They do not use phase estimation or variable-time amplitude amplification, and do not require large ancillary systems. We discuss a gate-based implementation via Hamiltonian simulation and prove that our second algorithm is almost optimal in terms of {$\kappa$}. Like previous methods, our techniques yield an exponential quantum speed-up under some assumptions. Our results emphasize the role of Hamiltonian-based models of quantum computing for the discovery of important algorithms.}

  abstract = {In this paper, we present an efficient quantum algorithm to simulate nonlinear differential equations with polynomial vector fields of arbitrary degree on quantum platforms. Models of physical systems that are governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or partial differential equation (PDEs) arise extensively in science and engineering applications and can be challenging to solve on classical computers due to high dimensionality, stiffness, nonlinearities, and sensitive dependence to initial conditions. For sparse n-dimensional linear ODEs, quantum algorithms have been developed which can produce a quantum state proportional to the solution in poly(log(n))) time using the quantum linear systems algorithm (QLSA). Recently, this framework was extended to systems of nonlinear ODEs with quadratic polynomial vector fields by applying Carleman linearization that enables the embedding of the quadratic system into an approximate linear form. A detailed complexity analysis was conducted which showed significant computational advantage under certain conditions. We present an extension of this algorithm to deal with systems of nonlinear ODEs with k-th degree polynomial vector fields for arbitrary (finite) values of k. The steps involve: 1) mapping the k-th degree polynomial ODE to a higher dimensional quadratic polynomial ODE; 2) applying Carleman linearization to transform the quadratic ODE to an infinite-dimensional system of linear ODEs; 3) truncating and discretizing the linear ODE and solving using the forward Euler method and QLSA. Alternatively, one could apply Carleman linearization directly to the k-th degree polynomial ODE, resulting in a system of infinite-dimensional linear ODEs, and then apply step 3. This solution route can be computationally more efficient. We present detailed complexity analysis of the proposed algorithms and prove polynomial scaling of runtime on k. We demonstrate the computational framework on a numerical example.},

Quantum turbulence is studied in a scalar GP system on 5,7603 grid yielding not only the classical Kolmogorov k-5/3 cascade but also the quantum vortex k-3 spectrum. For a certain class of initial conditions, one finds an intermittent loss of tangled quantum vortices as the vortex cores attain minimal size, and thus prevent the Kelvin wave cascade (due to helical wave-wave coupling on the vortex). A coupled set of GP equations are solved for spin or BEC. Skrymions, which describe topologically-linked quantum vortices, are examined. One finds, for certain initial conditions that the incompressible kinetic energy spectrum for the condensate component of a vortex ring core rapidly departs from the k-3 linear quantum vortex spectrum.},

A new 3D mesoscopic qubit unitary lattice algorithm is developed for this generalized NLS. One introduces 2 qubits for each lattice site and entangles them with a local unitary collision operator.

These interwined operators lead to an extremely well parallelized code on classical supcomputers while their unitary structure will permit encoding onto a quantum computer. Somewhat unexpectedly, the hyperbolic operator can be realized from variations in the collision operator, without introducing variations in the streaming operator.

The algorithm takes the HHL algorithm as the framework (where HHL is for solving linear equations). A more efficient way of implementing the controlled rotation, one of the crucial steps in HHL, is developed based on the arc cotangent function. The key point is that the inverse trigonometric function can be evaluated in a very simple recursive way by a binary expansion method. Quantum algorithms for solving square root and reciprocal functions are proposed based on the classical non-restoring method. These advances not only reduce the algorithm's complexity, but more importantly make the circuit more complete and practical. We demonstrate our circuits on a quantum virtual computing system installed on the Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer. This is an important step toward practical applications of the present circuits as a fast Poisson solver in the near-term hybrid classical/quantum devices.},

  abstract = {While quantum computing provides an exponential advantage in solving the system of linear equations, there is little work to solve the system of nonlinear equations with quantum computing. We propose quantum Newton's method (QNM) for solving  {$\mathsl{N}$} N -dimensional system of nonlinear equations based on Newton's method. In QNM, we solve the system of linear equations in each iteration of Newton's method with quantum linear system solver. We use a specific quantum data structure and  {$\mathsl{l}$} {$\infty$} l{$\infty$}  tomography with sample error  {$\in$} {$\mathsl{s}$} {$\epsilon$}s  to implement the classical-quantum data conversion process between the two iterations of QNM, thereby constructing the whole process of QNM. The complexity of QNM in each iteration is  {$\mathsl{O}$}( log 4 {$\mathsl{N}$}/ {$\in$} 2 {$\mathsl{s}$} ) O(log4N/{$\epsilon$}s2) . Through numerical simulation, we find that when  {$\in$} {$\mathsl{s}$} {$\gg$}1/ {$\mathsl{N}$} - - {$\surd$} {$\epsilon$}s{$\gg$}1/N , QNM is still effective, so the complexity of QNM is sublinear with  {$\mathsl{N}$} N , which provides quantum advantage compared with the optimal classical algorithm.},

  abstract = {Quantum algorithms have been developed for efficiently solving linear algebra tasks. However, they generally require deep circuits and hence universal fault-tolerant quantum computers. In this work, we propose variational algorithms for linear algebra tasks that are compatible with noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We show that the solutions of linear systems of equations and matrix\textendash vector multiplications can be translated as the ground states of the constructed Hamiltonians. Based on the variational quantum algorithms, we introduce Hamiltonian morphing together with an adaptive ans\"atz for efficiently finding the ground state, and show the solution verification. Our algorithms are especially suitable for linear algebra problems with sparse matrices, and have wide applications in machine learning and optimisation problems. The algorithm for matrix multiplications can be also used for Hamiltonian simulation and open system simulation. We evaluate the cost and effectiveness of our algorithm through numerical simulations for solving linear systems of equations. We implement the algorithm on the IBM quantum cloud device with a high solution fidelity of 99.95\%.},

  abstract = {Presented is a quantum lattice gas algorithm to efficiently model a system of Dirac particles interacting through an intermediary gauge field. The algorithm uses a fixed qubit array to represent both the spacetime and the particles contained in the spacetime. Despite being a lattice based algorithm, Lorentz invariance is preserved down to the grid scale, with the continuum Dirac Hamiltonian generating the local unitary evolution even at that scale: there is nonlinear scaling between the smallest observable time and that time measured in the quantum field theory limit, a kind of time dilation effect that emerges on small scales but has no effect on large scales. The quantum lattice gas algorithm correctly accounts for the anticommutative braiding of indistinguishable fermions|it does not suffer the Fermi-sign problem. It provides a highly convergent numerical simulation for strongly-correlated fermions equal to a covariant path integral, presented here for the case when a Dirac particle's Compton wavelength is large compared to the grid scale of the qubit array.}

  abstract = {Kinetic simulations of collisionless (or weakly collisional) plasmas using the Vlasov equation are often infeasible due to high resolution requirements and the exponential scaling of computational cost with respect to dimension. Recently, it has been proposed that matrix product state (MPS) methods, a quantum-inspired but classical algorithm, can be used to solve partial differential equations with exponential speed-up, provided that the solution can be compressed and efficiently represented as an MPS within some tolerable error threshold. In this work, we explore the practicality of MPS methods for solving the Vlasov-Poisson equations in 1D1V, and find that important features of linear and nonlinear dynamics, such as damping or growth rates and saturation amplitudes, can be captured while compressing the solution significantly. Furthermore, by comparing the performance of different mappings of the distribution functions onto the MPS, we develop an intuition of the MPS representation and its behavior in the context of solving the Vlasov-Poisson equations, which will be useful for extending these methods to higher dimensional problems.},

Here we explore utilizing quantum computers for the purpose of solving differential equations. We consider two approaches: (i) basis encoding and fixed-point arithmetic on a digital quantum computer, and (ii) representing and solving high-order Runge-Kutta methods as optimization problems on quantum annealers. As realizations applied to two-dimensional linear ordinary differential equations, we devise and simulate corresponding digital quantum circuits, and implement and run a 6\$\^\{\textbackslash mathrm\{th\}\}\$ order Gauss-Legendre collocation method on a D-Wave 2000Q system, showing good agreement with the reference solution. We find that the quantum annealing approach exhibits the largest potential for high-order implicit integration methods. As promising future scenario, the digital arithmetic method could be employed as an "oracle" within quantum search algorithms for inverse problems.},

High resolution (up to \$N=2\^\{17\}\$ grid points) hybrid numerical simulations of relativistic and non-relativistic hydrodynamical shocks on current IBM NISQs are performed with this algorithm and shown to reproduce equivalent simulations on classical computers. This work demonstrates that nonlinear fluid dynamics can be simulated on NISQs, and opens the door to simulating other, quantum and non-quantum fluids, including plasmas, with more general quantum walks and quantum automata.},
