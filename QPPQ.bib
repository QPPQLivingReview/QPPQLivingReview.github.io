  abstract = {This is a review of recent research exploring and extending present-day quantum computing capabilities for fusion energy science applications. We begin with a brief tutorial on both ideal and open quantum dynamics, universal quantum computation, and quantum algorithms. Then, we explore the topic of using quantum computers to simulate both linear and nonlinear dynamics in greater detail. Because quantum computers can only efficiently perform linear operations on the quantum state, it is challenging to perform nonlinear operations that are generically required to describe the nonlinear differential equations of interest. In this work, we extend previous results on embedding nonlinear systems within linear systems by explicitly deriving the connection between the Koopman evolution operator, the Perron-Frobenius evolution operator, and the Koopman-von Neumann evolution (KvN) operator. We also explicitly derive the connection between the Koopman and Carleman approaches to embedding. Extension of the KvN framework to the complex-analytic setting relevant to Carleman embedding, and the proof that different choices of complex analytic reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces depend on the choice of Hilbert space metric are covered in the appendices. Finally, we conclude with a review of recent quantum hardware implementations of algorithms on present-day quantum hardware platforms that may one day be accelerated through Hamiltonian simulation. We discuss the simulation of toy models of wave-particle interactions through the simulation of quantum maps and of wave-wave interactions important in nonlinear plasma dynamics.},

	title = {Quantum algorithmic differentiation},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13370},
	abstract = {In this work we present an algorithm to perform algorithmic diﬀerentiation in the context of quantum computing. For the derivative of the arbitrary composite function f ◦ g ◦ ... ◦ h, three n-qubit states are suﬃcient, where n refers to the quantum computer precision. Namely, with these 3 n-qubit states we construct a set of operation which can be iteratively applied in such a way to calculate the derivative of any composite function. For the sum, f (x) + g(x) + ... + h(x) or the product f (x) · g(x) · ... · h(x) one needs at least 6 n-qubit states, if a re-initialization is implemented. Since the implementation of elementary functions is already possible on quantum computers, the scheme that we propose can be easily applied. Moreover, since some steps (such as the CNOT operator) can (or will be) faster on a quantum computer than on a classical one, the applied procedure may lead in the (near or far) future to quantum algorithmic diﬀerentiation being more advantageous than its classical counterpart.},

	title = {Quantum algorithms for the polynomial eigenvalue problems},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15027},
	abstract = {Polynomial eigenvalue problems (PEPs) arise in a variety of science and engineering applications, and many breakthroughs in the development of classical algorithms to solve PEPs have been made in the past decades. Here we attempt to solve PEPs in a quantum computer. Firstly, for generalized eigenvalue problems (GEPs) Ax = λBx with A, B symmetric, and B positive deﬁnite, we give a quantum algorithm based on block-encoding and quantum phase estimation. In a more general case when B is invertible, B−1A is diagonalizable and all the eigenvalues are real, we propose a quantum algorithm based on the Fourier spectral method to solve ordinary diﬀerential equations (ODEs). The inputs of our algorithms can be any desired states, and the outputs are superpositions of the eigenpairs. The complexities are polylog in the matrix size and linear in the precision. The dependence on precision is opt√imal. Secondly, we show that when B is singular, any quantum algorithm uses at least Ω( n) queries to compute the eigenvalues, where n is the matrix size. Thirdly, based on the linearization method and the connection between PEPs and higher-order ODEs, we provide two quantum algorithms to solve PEPs by extending the quantum algorithm for GEPs. We also give detailed complexity analysis of the algorithm for two special types of quadratic eigenvalue problems that are important in practice. Finally, under an extra assumption, we propose a quantum algorithm to solve PEPs when the eigenvalues are complex.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15776},
	abstract = {Quantum algorithms for both differential equation solving and for machine learning potentially offer an exponential speedup over all known classical algorithms. However, there also exist obstacles to obtaining this potential speedup in useful problem instances. The essential obstacle for quantum differential equation solving is that outputting useful information may require difficult post-processing, and the essential obstacle for quantum machine learning is that inputting the training set is a difficult task just by itself. In this paper, we demonstrate, when combined, these difficulties solve one another. We show how the output of quantum differential equation solving can serve as the input for quantum machine learning, allowing dynamical analysis in terms of principal components, power spectra, and wavelet decompositions. To illustrate this, we consider continuous time Markov processes on epidemiological and social networks. These quantum algorithms provide an exponential advantage over existing classical Monte Carlo methods.},

	title = {Variational quantum simulations of stochastic differential equations},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04429},
	abstract = {Stochastic differential equations (SDE), which models uncertain phenomena as the time evolution of random variables, are exploited in various fields of natural and social sciences such as finance. Since SDEs rarely admit analytical solutions and must usually be solved numerically with huge classical-computational resources in practical applications, there is strong motivation to use quantum computation to accelerate the calculation. Here, we propose a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm that solves SDEs based on variational quantum simulation (VQS). We first approximate the target SDE by a trinomial tree structure with discretization and then formulate it as the time-evolution of a quantum state embedding the probability distributions of the SDE variables. We embed the probability distribution directly in the amplitudes of the quantum state while the previous studies did the square-root of the probability distribution in the amplitudes. Our embedding enables us to construct simple quantum circuits that simulate the time-evolution of the state for general SDEs. We also develop a scheme to compute the expectation values of the SDE variables and discuss whether our scheme can achieve quantum speed-up for the expectation-value evaluations of the SDE variables. Finally, we numerically validate our algorithm by simulating several types of stochastic processes. Our proposal provides a new direction for simulating SDEs on quantum computers.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06681},
	abstract = {The simulation of large nonlinear dynamical systems, including systems generated by discretization of hyperbolic partial differential equations, can be computationally extreme. Such systems are important in both fluid and kinetic computational plasma physics. This motivates exploring whether a future error-corrected quantum computer could perform these simulations more efficiently than any classical computer. We introduce a framework for mapping any finite nonlinear dynamical system to an infinite linear dynamical system (embedding) and detail three specific cases of this framework that correspond to previously-studied mappings. Additionally, we explore an approach for approximating the resulting infinite linear system with finite linear systems (truncation). A quantum computer could simulate these finite linear systems using a number of qubits that scales only logarithmically with the number of variables of the original nonlinear system. Computational efficiency of the three detailed embedding strategies is discussed.},

	title = {Variational {Quantum} algorithm for {Poisson} equation},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07014},
	abstract = {The Poisson equation has wide applications in many areas of science and engineering. Although there are some quantum algorithms that can efficiently solve the Poisson equation, they generally require a fault-tolerant quantum computer which is beyond the current technology. In this paper, we propose a Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) to solve the Poisson equation, which can be executed on Noise Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. In detail, we first adopt the finite difference method to transform the Poisson equation into a linear system. Then, according to the special structure of the linear system, we find an explicit tensor product decomposition, with only \$2{\textbackslash}log n+1\$ items, of its coefficient matrix under a specific set of simple operators, where \$n\$ is the dimension of the coefficient matrix. This implies that the proposed VQA only needs \$O({\textbackslash}log n)\$ measurements, which dramatically reduce quantum resources. Additionally, we perform quantum Bell measurements to efficiently evaluate the expectation values of simple operators. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can effectively solve the Poisson equation.},

Here we explore utilizing quantum computers for the purpose of solving differential equations. We consider two approaches: (i) basis encoding and fixed-point arithmetic on a digital quantum computer, and (ii) representing and solving high-order Runge-Kutta methods as optimization problems on quantum annealers. As realizations applied to two-dimensional linear ordinary differential equations, we devise and simulate corresponding digital quantum circuits, and implement and run a 6\${\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{th\}\}\$ order Gauss-Legendre collocation method on a D-Wave 2000Q system, showing good agreement with the reference solution. We find that the quantum annealing approach exhibits the largest potential for high-order implicit integration methods. As promising future scenario, the digital arithmetic method could be employed as an "oracle" within quantum search algorithms for inverse problems.},

	abstract = {The controls enacting logical operations on quantum systems are described by time-dependent Hamiltonians that often include rapid oscillations. In order to accurately capture the resulting time dynamics in numerical simulations, a very small integration time step is required, which can severely impact the simulation run-time. Here, we introduce a semi-analytic method based on the Dyson expansion that allows us to time-evolve driven quantum systems much faster than standard numerical integrators. This solver, which we name Dysolve, efficiently captures the effect of the highly oscillatory terms in the system Hamiltonian, significantly reducing the simulation's run time as well as its sensitivity to the time-step size. Furthermore, this solver provides the exact derivative of the time-evolution operator with respect to the drive amplitudes. This key feature allows for optimal control in the limit of strong drives and goes beyond common pulse-optimization approaches that rely on rotating-wave approximations. As an illustration of our method, we show results of the optimization of a two-qubit gate using transmon qubits in the circuit QED architecture.},

	title = {Pricing {Financial} {Derivatives} with {Exponential} {Quantum} {Speedup}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04023},
	abstract = {Pricing financial derivatives, in particular European-style options at different time-maturities and strikes, is a relevant financial problem. The dynamics describing the price of vanilla options when constant volatilities and interest rates are assumed, is governed by the Black-Scholes model, a linear parabolic partial differential equation with terminal value given by the pay-off of the option contract and no additional boundary conditions. Here, we present a digital quantum algorithm to solve Black-Scholes equation on a quantum computer for a wide range of relevant financial parameters by mapping it to the Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger equation. The non-Hermitian nature of the resulting Hamiltonian is solved by embedding the dynamics into an enlarged Hilbert space, which makes use of only one additional ancillary qubit. Moreover, we employ a second ancillary qubit to transform initial condition into periodic boundary conditions, which substantially improves the stability and performance of the protocol. This algorithm shows a feasible approach for pricing financial derivatives on a digital quantum computer based on Hamiltonian simulation, technique which differs from those based on Monte Carlo simulations to solve the stochastic counterpart of the Black Scholes equation. Our algorithm remarkably provides an exponential speedup since the terms in the Hamiltonian can be truncated by a polynomial number of interactions while keeping the error bounded. We report expected accuracy levels comparable to classical numerical algorithms by using 10 qubits and 94 entangling gates on a fault-tolerant quantum computer, and an expected success probability of the post-selection procedure due to the embedding protocol above 60{\textbackslash}\%.},

The non-linearity of ﬂuid ﬂow equations is managed by using the stream function-vorticity formulation, while the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is utilized for solving the corresponding system of equations numerically. Following the nature of the lattice Boltzmann method, the proposed quantum algorithm consists of ﬁve major sections: initialization, collision, propagation, boundary condition implementation, and macros calculation. The collision and boundary condition step is quantumly implemented by applying the standard-form encoding approach, while the quantum walk procedure is applied for the propagation step.

% 	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10309},
% 	abstract = {We establish an improved classical algorithm for solving linear systems in a model analogous to the QRAM that is used by quantum linear solvers. Precisely, for the linear system \$A{\textbackslash}x = {\textbackslash}b\$, we show that there is a classical algorithm that outputs a data structure for \${\textbackslash}x\$ allowing sampling and querying to the entries, where \${\textbackslash}x\$ is such that \${\textbackslash}{\textbar}{\textbackslash}x - A{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash}b{\textbackslash}{\textbar}{\textbackslash}leq {\textbackslash}epsilon {\textbackslash}{\textbar}A{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash}b{\textbackslash}{\textbar}\$. This output can be viewed as a classical analogue to the output of quantum linear solvers. The complexity of our algorithm is \${\textbackslash}widetilde\{O\}({\textbackslash}kappa\_F{\textasciicircum}6 {\textbackslash}kappa{\textasciicircum}2/{\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}2 )\$, where \${\textbackslash}kappa\_F = {\textbackslash}{\textbar}A{\textbackslash}{\textbar}\_F{\textbackslash}{\textbar}A{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash}{\textbar}\$ and \${\textbackslash}kappa = {\textbackslash}{\textbar}A{\textbackslash}{\textbar}{\textbackslash}{\textbar}A{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash}{\textbar}\$. This improves the previous best algorithm [Gily\{{\textbackslash}'e\}n, Song and Tang, arXiv:2009.07268] of complexity \${\textbackslash}widetilde\{O\}({\textbackslash}kappa\_F{\textasciicircum}6 {\textbackslash}kappa{\textasciicircum}6/{\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}4)\$. Our algorithm is based on the randomized Kaczmarz method, which is a particular case of stochastic gradient descent. We also find that when \$A\$ is row sparse, this method already returns an approximate solution \${\textbackslash}x\$ in time \${\textbackslash}widetilde\{O\}({\textbackslash}kappa\_F{\textasciicircum}2)\$, while the best quantum algorithm known returns \${\textbackslash}ket\{{\textbackslash}x\}\$ in time \${\textbackslash}widetilde\{O\}({\textbackslash}kappa\_F)\$ when \$A\$ is stored in the QRAM data structure. As a result, assuming access to QRAM and if \$A\$ is row sparse, the speedup based on current quantum algorithms is quadratic.},

To tackle these shortcomings, we implement Tensor Neural Networks (TNN), a quantum-inspired neural network architecture that leverages Tensor Network ideas to improve upon deep learning approaches. We demonstrate that TNN provide significant parameter savings while attaining the same accuracy as compared to the classical Dense Neural Network (DNN). In addition, we also show how TNN can be trained faster than DNN for the same accuracy. We benchmark TNN by applying them to solve parabolic PDEs, specifically the Black-Scholes-Barenblatt equation, widely used in financial pricing theory, empirically showing the advantages of TNN over DNN.

	abstract = {The matrix functions can be defined by Cauchy's integral formula and can be approximated by the linear combination of inverses of shifted matrices using a quadrature formula. In this paper, we show a concrete construction of a framework to implement the linear combination of the inverses on quantum computers and propose a quantum algorithm for matrix functions based on the framework. Compared with the previous study [S. Takahira, A. Ohashi, T. Sogabe, and T.S. Usuda, Quant. Inf. Comput., 20, 1\&2, 14--36, (Feb. 2020)] that proposed a quantum algorithm to compute a quantum state for the matrix function based on the circular contour centered at the origin, the quantum algorithm in the present paper can be applied to a more general contour. Moreover, the algorithm is described by the block-encoding framework. Similarly to the previous study, the algorithm can be applied even if the input matrix is not a Hermitian or normal matrix.},

% 	abstract = {Computer-aided engineering techniques are indispensable in modern engineering developments. In particular, partial differential equations are commonly used to simulate the dynamics of physical phenomena, but very large systems are often intractable within a reasonable computation time, even when using supercomputers. To overcome the inherent limit of classical computing, we present a variational quantum algorithm for solving the Poisson equation that can be implemented in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. The proposed method defines the total potential energy of the Poisson equation as a Hamiltonian, which is decomposed into a linear combination of Pauli operators and simple observables. The expectation value of the Hamiltonian is then minimized with respect to a parameterized quantum state. Because the number of decomposed terms is independent of the size of the problem, this method requires relatively few quantum measurements. Numerical experiments demonstrate the faster computing speed of this method compared with classical computing methods and a previous variational quantum approach. We believe that our approach brings quantum computer-aided techniques closer to future applications in engineering developments.},

In our work, based on the homotopy perturbation method, we propose a quantum algorithm for solving n-dimensional nonlinear dissipative ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Our algorithm first converts the original nonlinear ODEs into the other nonlinear ODEs which can be embedded into finite-dimensional linear ODEs. Then we solve the embedded linear ODEs with quantum linear ODEs algorithm and obtain a state ϵ-close to the normalized exact solution of the original nonlinear ODEs with success probability Ω(1). The complexity of our algorithm is O(gηT poly(log(nT/ϵ))), where η, g measure the decay of the solution. Our algorithm provides exponential improvement over the best classical algorithms or previous quantum algorithms in n or ϵ.}

We propose quantum Newton's method (QNM) for solving \$N\$-dimensional system of nonlinear equations based on Newton's method. In QNM, we solve the system of linear equations in each iteration of Newton's method with quantum linear system solver. We use a specific quantum data structure and \$l\_\{{\textbackslash}infty\}\$ tomography with sample error \${\textbackslash}epsilon\_s\$ to implement the classical-quantum data conversion process between the two iterations of QNM, thereby constructing the whole process of QNM. The complexity of QNM in each iteration is \$O({\textbackslash}log{\textasciicircum}4N/{\textbackslash}epsilon\_s{\textasciicircum}2)\$. Through numerical simulation, we find that when \${\textbackslash}epsilon\_s{\textgreater}{\textgreater}1/{\textbackslash}sqrt\{N\}\$, QNM is still effective, so the complexity of QNM is sublinear with \$N\$, which provides quantum advantage compared with the optimal classical algorithm.},

	abstract = {To solve nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) is one of the most common but important tasks in not only basic sciences but also many practical industries. We here propose a quantum variational (QuVa) PDE solver with the aid of machine learning (ML) schemes to synergise two emerging technologies in mathematically hard problems. The core quantum processing in this solver is to calculate efficiently the expectation value of specially designed quantum operators. For a large quantum system, we only obtain data from measurements of few control qubits to avoid the exponential cost in the measurements of the whole quantum system and optimise a pathway to find possible solution sets of the desired PDEs using ML techniques. As an example, a few different types of the second-order DEs are examined with randomly chosen samples and a regression method is implemented to chase the best candidates of solution functions with another trial samples. We demonstrated that a three-qubit system successfully follows the pattern of analytical solutions of three different DEs with high fidelity since the variational solutions are given by a necessary condition to obtain the exact solution of the DEs. Thus, we believe that final solution candidate sets are efficiently extracted from the QuVa PDE solver with the support of ML techniques and this algorithm could be beneficial to search for the solutions of complex mathematical problems as well as to find good ansatzs for eigenstates in large quantum systems (e.g., for quantum chemistry).},

Here, we propose to overcome the limitations of the explicit split-operator algorithm by abandoning its explicit nature. We describe a family of high-order implicit split-operator algorithms that are norm-conserving, time-reversible, and very efficient. The geometric properties of the integrators are proven analytically and demonstrated numerically on the local control of a two-dimensional model of retinal. Although they are only applicable to separable Hamiltonians, the implicit split-operator algorithms are, in this setting, more efficient than the recently proposed integrators based on the implicit midpoint method.},

As components of our algorithm, the HHL solver is applied to an augmented linear system of the resolvent matrices, and the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is adopted to represent the operation of the numerical contour integral. To reduce the size of the augmented system, we exploit a certain symmetry of the numerical integration. We also introduce a permutation formed by CNOT gates to make the augmented system solution consistent with the QFT input.

Furthermore, we extend this approach to address the general black-box state preparation problem where the transduced coefficient is a general non-linear function.

  abstract = {An n-qubit quantum circuit performs a unitary operation on an exponentially large, 2n-dimensional, Hilbert space, which is a major source of quantum speed-ups. We develop a new “Quantum singular value transformation” algorithm that can directly harness the advantages of exponential dimensionality by applying polynomial transformations to the singular values of a block of a unitary operator. The transformations are realized by quantum circuits with a very simple structure - typically using only a constant number of ancilla qubits - leading to optimal algorithms with appealing constant factors. We show that our framework allows describing many quantum algorithms on a high level, and enables remarkably concise proofs for many prominent quantum algorithms, ranging from optimal Hamiltonian simulation to various quantum machine learning applications. We also devise a new singular vector transformation algorithm, describe how to exponentially improve the complexity of implementing fractional queries to unitaries with a gapped spectrum, and show how to efficiently implement principal component regression. Finally, we also prove a quantum lower bound on spectral transformations.},

Inspired by this idea, we present eight quantum-inspired numerical analysis algorithms, that include Fourier sampling, interpolation, differentiation and integration of partial derivative equations. These algorithms combine classical ideas -- finite-differences, spectral methods -- with the efficient encoding of quantum registers, and well known algorithms, such as the Quantum Fourier Transform. \{When these heuristic methods work\}, they provide an exponential speed-up over other classical algorithms, such as Monte Carlo integration, finite-difference and fast Fourier transforms (FFT).

Recent advances in deep learning have enabled us to solve them in a higher dimension by addressing the curse of dimensionality in new ways. However, deep learning methods are constrained by training time and memory. To tackle these shortcomings, we implement Tensor Neural Networks (TNN), a quantum-inspired neural network architecture that leverages Tensor Network ideas to improve upon deep learning approaches. We demonstrate that TNN provide significant parameter savings while attaining the same accuracy as compared to the classical Dense Neural Network (DNN). In addition, we also show how TNN can be trained faster than DNN for the same accuracy. We benchmark TNN by applying them to solve parabolic PDEs, specifically the Black-Scholes-Barenblatt equation, widely used in financial pricing theory, empirically showing the advantages of TNN over DNN. Further examples, such as the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, are also discussed.},

Precisely, for the linear system \$A\textbackslash x = \textbackslash b\$, we show that there is a classical algorithm that outputs a data structure for \$\textbackslash x\$ allowing sampling and querying to the entries, where \$\textbackslash x\$ is such that \$\textbackslash |\textbackslash x - A\^\{-1\}\textbackslash b\textbackslash |\textbackslash leq \textbackslash epsilon \textbackslash |A\^\{-1\}\textbackslash b\textbackslash |\$. This output can be viewed as a classical analogue to the output of quantum linear solvers. The complexity of our algorithm is \$\textbackslash widetilde\{O\}(\textbackslash kappa\_F\^6 \textbackslash kappa\^2/\textbackslash epsilon\^2 )\$, where \$\textbackslash kappa\_F = \textbackslash |A\textbackslash |\_F\textbackslash |A\^\{-1\}\textbackslash |\$ and \$\textbackslash kappa = \textbackslash |A\textbackslash |\textbackslash |A\^\{-1\}\textbackslash |\$. This improves the previous best algorithm [Gily\{\textbackslash 'e\}n, Song and Tang, arXiv:2009.07268] of complexity \$\textbackslash widetilde\{O\}(\textbackslash kappa\_F\^6 \textbackslash kappa\^6/\textbackslash epsilon\^4)\$. Our algorithm is based on the randomized Kaczmarz method, which is a particular case of stochastic gradient descent. We also find that when \$A\$ is row sparse, this method already returns an approximate solution \$\textbackslash x\$ in time \$\textbackslash widetilde\{O\}(\textbackslash kappa\_F\^2)\$, while the best quantum algorithm known returns \$\textbackslash ket\{\textbackslash x\}\$ in time \$\textbackslash widetilde\{O\}(\textbackslash kappa\_F)\$ when \$A\$ is stored in the QRAM data structure. As a result, assuming access to QRAM and if \$A\$ is row sparse, the speedup based on current quantum algorithms is quadratic.},

Recently, it has been proposed that matrix product state (MPS) methods, a quantum-inspired but classical algorithm, can be used to solve partial differential equations with exponential speed-up, provided that the solution can be compressed and efficiently represented as an MPS within some tolerable error threshold. In this work, we explore the practicality of MPS methods for solving the Vlasov-Poisson equations in 1D1V, and find that important features of linear and nonlinear dynamics, such as damping or growth rates and saturation amplitudes, can be captured while compressing the solution significantly. Furthermore, by comparing the performance of different mappings of the distribution functions onto the MPS, we develop an intuition of the MPS representation and its behavior in the context of solving the Vlasov-Poisson equations, which will be useful for extending these methods to higher dimensional problems.},

  abstract = {There has been significant progress in the development of quantum algorithms for solving linear systems of equations with a growing body of applications to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and CFD-like problems. This work extends previous work by developing a non-linear hybrid quantum-classical CFD solver and using it to generate fully converged solutions. The hybrid solver uses the SIMPLE CFD algorithm, which is common in many industrial CFD codes, and applies it to the 2-dimensional lid driven cavity test case. A theme of this work is the classical processing time needed to prepare the quantum circuit with a focus on the decomposition of the CFD matrix into a linear combination of unitaries (LCU). CFD meshes with up to 65x65 nodes are considered with the largest producing a LCU containing 32,767 Pauli strings. A new method for rapidly re-computing the coefficients in a LCU is proposed, although this reduces, rather than eliminates, the classical scaling issues. The quantum linear equation solver uses the Harrow, Hassidim, Lloyd (HHL) algorithm via a state-vector emulator. Test matrices are sampled from the classical CFD solver to investigate the solution accuracy that can be achieved with HHL. For the smallest 5x5 and 9x9 CFD meshes, full non-linear hybrid CFD calculations are performed. The impacts of approximating the LCU and the varying the number of ancilla rotations in the eigenvalue inversion circuit are studied. Preliminary timing results indicate that the classical computer preparation time needed for a hybrid solver is just as important to the achievement of quantum advantage in CFD as the time on the quantum computer. The reported HHL solutions and LCU decompositions provide a benchmark for future research. The CFD test matrices used in this study are available upon request.},

  abstract = {In this work, we obtain the numerical temperature field to a thermally developing fluid flow inside parallel plates problem with a quantum computing method. The physical problem deals with the heat transfer of a steady state, hydrodinamically developed and thermally developing fluid flow inside two parallel plates channel subjected to a prescribed constant heat flux. Its solution is formulated numerically with Finite Differences method, where a sequence of linear systems must be solved in order to determine the complete temperature field. Such linear systems are written as discrete unconstrained optimization problems with floating points being approximated using binary variables and solved using near-term quantum heuristics. Due to the exponential cost of simulating quantum algorithms, a reduced number of qubits had to be used in the simulations, causing a loss of precision in the results. However, this work advances the state of the art of solutions of differential equations with noisy quantum devices and could be used for useful applications when quantum computers with thousands of qubits become available.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in quantum computing and their increased availability has led to a growing interest in possible applications. Among those is the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) for, e.g., material or flow simulation. Currently, the most promising route to useful deployment of quantum processors in the short to near term are so-called hybrid variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). Thus, variational methods for PDEs have been proposed as a candidate for quantum advantage in the noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era. In this work, we conduct an extensive study of utilizing VQAs on real quantum devices to solve the simplest prototype of a PDE -- the Poisson equation. Although results on noiseless simulators for small problem sizes may seem deceivingly promising, the performance on quantum computers is very poor. We argue that direct resolution of PDEs via an amplitude encoding of the solution is not a good use case within reach of today's quantum devices -- especially when considering large system sizes and more complicated non-linear PDEs that are required in order to be competitive with classical high-end solvers.},

Quantum computing could potentially address both of these challenges. Herein, we present one method to perform fluid dynamics calculations that takes advantage of quantum computing. This hybrid quantum-classical method, which combines several algorithms, scales logarithmically with the dimension of the vector space and quadratically with the number of nonzero terms in the linear combination of unitary operators that specifies the linear operator describing the system of interest. As a demonstration, we apply our method to solve the advection-diffusion equation for a small system using IBM quantum computers. We find that reliable solutions of the equation can be obtained on even the noisy quantum computers available today. This and other methods that exploit quantum computers could replace some of our traditional methods in numerical weather prediction as quantum hardware continues to improve.},

Through statevector simulations of the heat equation, we demonstrate how the time complexity of our algorithm scales with the ansatz volume for gradient estimation and how the time-to-solution scales with the diffusion parameter. Our proposed algorithm extends economically to higher-order time-stepping schemes, such as the Crank-Nicolson method.

  abstract = {Quantum algorithms for solving linear systems of equations have generated excitement because of the potential speed-ups involved and the importance of solving linear equations in many applications. However, applying these algorithms can be challenging. The Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm and improvements thereof require complex subroutines suitable for fault-tolerant hardware such as Hamiltonian simulation, making it ill-suited to current hardware. Variational algorithms, on the other hand, involve expensive optimization loops, which can be prone to barren plateaus and local optima. We describe a quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations that avoids these problems. Our algorithm is based on the Woodbury identity, which analytically describes the inverse of a matrix that is a low-rank modification of another (easily-invertible) matrix. This approach only utilizes basic quantum subroutines like the Hadamard test or the swap test, so it is well-suited to current hardware. There is no optimization loop, so barren plateaus and local optima do not present a problem. The low-rank aspect of the identity enables us to efficiently transfer information to and from the quantum computer. This approach can produce accurate results on current hardware. As evidence of this, we estimate an inner product involving the solution of a system of more than 16 million equations with 2\% error using IBM's Auckland quantum computer. To our knowledge, no system of equations this large has previously been solved to this level of accuracy on a quantum computer.},

  abstract = {The Poisson equation has many applications across the broad areas of science and engineering. Most quantum algorithms for the Poisson solver presented so far either suffer from lack of accuracy and/or are limited to very small sizes of the problem, and thus have no practical usage. Here we present an advanced quantum algorithm for solving the Poisson equation with high accuracy and dynamically tunable problem size. After converting the Poisson equation to a linear system through the finite difference method, we adopt the HHL algorithm as the basic framework. Particularly, in this work we present an advanced circuit that ensures the accuracy of the solution by implementing non-truncated eigenvalues through eigenvalue amplification, as well as by increasing the accuracy of the controlled rotation angular coefficients, which are the critical factors in the HHL algorithm. Consequently, we are able to drastically reduce the relative error in the solution while achieving higher success probability as the amplification level is increased. We show that our algorithm not only increases the accuracy of the solutions but also composes more practical and scalable circuits by dynamically controlling problem size in NISQ devices. We present both simulated and experimental results and discuss the sources of errors. Finally, we conclude that though overall results on the existing NISQ hardware are dominated by the error in the CNOT gates, this work opens a path to realizing a multidimensional Poisson solver on near-term quantum hardware.},

Previous algorithms had optimal or near-optimal scaling in some parameters at the cost of poor scaling in others. Hamiltonian simulation via a quantum walk has optimal dependence on the sparsity at the expense of poor scaling in the allowed error. In contrast, an approach based on fractional-query simulation provides optimal scaling in the error at the expense of poor scaling in the sparsity. Here we combine the two approaches, achieving the best features of both. By implementing a linear combination of quantum walk steps with coefficients given by Bessel functions, our algorithm's complexity (as measured by the number of queries and 2-qubit gates) is logarithmic in the inverse error, and nearly linear in the product \$\textbackslash tau\$ of the evolution time, the sparsity, and the magnitude of the largest entry of the Hamiltonian. Our dependence on the error is optimal, and we prove a new lower bound showing that no algorithm can have sublinear dependence on \$\textbackslash tau\$.},

[1] demonstrated the first efficient quantum algorithm for dissipative quadratic differential equations under the condition \$R \&lt; 1\$, where \$R\$ measures the ratio of nonlinearity to dissipation using the \$\textbackslash ell\_2\$ norm. Here we develop an efficient quantum algorithm based on [1] for reaction-diffusion equations, a class of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). To achieve this, we improve upon the Carleman linearization approach introduced in [1] to obtain a faster convergence rate under the condition \$R\_D \&lt; 1\$, where \$R\_D\$ measures the ratio of nonlinearity to dissipation using the \$\textbackslash ell\_\{\textbackslash infty\}\$ norm. Since \$R\_D\$ is independent of the number of spatial grid points \$n\$ while \$R\$ increases with \$n\$, the criterion \$R\_D\&lt;1\$ is significantly milder than \$R\&lt;1\$ for high-dimensional systems and can stay convergent under grid refinement for approximating PDEs. As applications of our quantum algorithm we consider the Fisher-KPP and Allen-Cahn equations, which have interpretations in classical physics. In particular, we show how to estimate the mean square kinetic energy in the solution by postprocessing the quantum state that encodes it to extract derivative information.},

  abstract = {The time-marching strategy, which propagates the solution from one time step to the next, is a natural strategy for solving time-dependent differential equations on classical computers, as well as for solving the Hamiltonian simulation problem on quantum computers. For more general linear differential equations, a time-marching based quantum solver can suffer from exponentially vanishing success probability with respect to the number of time steps and is thus considered impractical. We solve this problem by repeatedly invoking a technique called the uniform singular value amplification, and the overall success probability can be lower bounded by a quantity that is independent of the number of time steps. The success probability can be further improved using a compression gadget lemma. This provides a path of designing quantum differential equation solvers that is alternative to those based on quantum linear systems algorithms (QLSA). We demonstrate the performance of the time-marching strategy with a high-order integrator based on the truncated Dyson series. The complexity of the algorithm depends linearly on the amplification ratio, which quantifies the deviation from a unitary dynamics. We prove that the linear dependence on the amplification ratio attains the query complexity lower bound and thus cannot be improved in general. This algorithm also surpasses existing QLSA based solvers in three aspects: (1) the coefficient matrix \$A(t)\$ does not need to be diagonalizable. (2) \$A(t)\$ can be non-smooth, and is only of bounded variation. (3) It can use fewer queries to the initial state. Finally, we demonstrate the time-marching strategy with a first-order truncated Magnus series, while retaining the aforementioned benefits. Our analysis also raises some open questions concerning the differences between time-marching and QLSA based methods for solving differential equations.},

The algorithm is a continuous-variable version of matrix inversion: it efficiently inverts differential operators that are polynomials in the variables and their partial derivatives. The output is a quantum state whose wave function is proportional to a specific solution of the nonhomogeneous differential equation, which can be measured to reveal features of the solution. The algorithm consists of three stages: preparing fixed resource states in ancillary systems, performing Hamiltonian simulation, and measuring the ancilla systems. The algorithm can be carried out using standard methods for gate decompositions, but we improve this in two ways. First, we show that for a wide class of differential operators, it is possible to derive exact decompositions for the gates employed in Hamiltonian simulation. This avoids the need for costly commutator approximations, reducing gate counts by orders of magnitude. Additionally, we employ methods from machine learning to find explicit circuits that prepare the required resource states. We conclude by studying two example applications of the algorithm: solving Poisson's equation in electrostatics and performing one-dimensional integration.}

Assuming \$R {$<$} 1\$, where \$R\$ is a parameter characterizing the ratio of the nonlinearity to the linear dissipation, this algorithm has complexity \$T\^2\textbackslash mathrm\{poly\}(\textbackslash log T, \textbackslash log n)/\textbackslash epsilon\$, where \$T\$ is the evolution time and \$\textbackslash epsilon\$ is the allowed error in the output quantum state.

This method maps a system of nonlinear differential equations to an infinite-dimensional system of linear differential equations, which we discretize, truncate, and solve using the forward Euler method and the quantum linear system algorithm. We also provide a lower bound on the worst-case complexity of quantum algorithms for general quadratic differential equations, showing that the problem is intractable for \$R \textbackslash ge \textbackslash sqrt\{2\}\$.

We consider the representative general question of approximately computing a linear functional of the solution to a boundary value problem and compare the quantum algorithm's theoretical performance with that of a standard classical algorithm\textemdash the conjugate gradient method. Prior work claimed that the quantum algorithm could be exponentially faster but did not determine the overall classical and quantum run times required to achieve a predetermined solution accuracy.

Although reliable CFD results can be obtained with turbulence models, direct numerical simulation of complex bodies in three spatial dimensions (3D) is impracticable due to the massive amount of computational elements. For instance, a 3D direct numerical simulation of a turbulent boundary-layer over the wing of a commercial jetliner that resolves all relevant length scales using a serial CFD solver on a modern digital computer would take approximately 750~million years or roughly 20\% of the earth's age.

In this paper, we adapt a recently introduced quantum algorithm for partial differential equations to Burgers' equation and develop a quantum CFD solver that determines its solutions. We used our quantum CFD solver to verify the quantum Burgers' equation algorithm to find the flow solution when a shockwave is and is not present. The quantum simulation results were compared to: (i) an exact analytical solution for a flow without a shockwave; and (ii) the results of a classical CFD solver for flows with and without a shockwave. Excellent agreement was found in both cases, and the error of the quantum CFD solver was comparable to that of the classical CFD solver.},

Models of physical systems that are governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or partial differential equation (PDEs) arise extensively in science and engineering applications and can be challenging to solve on classical computers due to high dimensionality, stiffness, nonlinearities, and sensitive dependence to initial conditions. For sparse n-dimensional linear ODEs, quantum algorithms have been developed which can produce a quantum state proportional to the solution in poly(log(n))) time using the quantum linear systems algorithm (QLSA). Recently, this framework was extended to systems of nonlinear ODEs with quadratic polynomial vector fields by applying Carleman linearization that enables the embedding of the quadratic system into an approximate linear form. A detailed complexity analysis was conducted which showed significant computational advantage under certain conditions. We present an extension of this algorithm to deal with systems of nonlinear ODEs with k-th degree polynomial vector fields for arbitrary (finite) values of k. The steps involve: 1) mapping the k-th degree polynomial ODE to a higher dimensional quadratic polynomial ODE; 2) applying Carleman linearization to transform the quadratic ODE to an infinite-dimensional system of linear ODEs; 3) truncating and discretizing the linear ODE and solving using the forward Euler method and QLSA. Alternatively, one could apply Carleman linearization directly to the k-th degree polynomial ODE, resulting in a system of infinite-dimensional linear ODEs, and then apply step 3. This solution route can be computationally more efficient. We present detailed complexity analysis of the proposed algorithms and prove polynomial scaling of runtime on k.

Existing quantum algorithms have demonstrated the potential for large speedups, but the required quantum resources are not immediately available on near-term quantum devices. In this work, we study near-term quantum algorithms for linear systems of equations of the form \$Ax = b\$. We investigate the use of variational algorithms and analyze their optimization landscapes. There exist types of linear systems for which variational algorithms designed to avoid barren plateaus, such as properly-initialized imaginary time evolution and adiabatic-inspired optimization, suffer from a different plateau problem. To circumvent this issue, we design near-term algorithms based on a core idea: the classical combination of variational quantum states (CQS). We exhibit several provable guarantees for these algorithms, supported by the representation of the linear system on a so-called Ansatz tree. The CQS approach and the Ansatz tree also admit the systematic application of heuristic approaches, including a gradient-based search. We have conducted numerical experiments solving linear systems as large as \$2{\textasciicircum}\{300\} {\textbackslash}times 2{\textasciicircum}\{300\}\$ by considering cases where we can simulate the quantum algorithm efficiently on a classical computer.

	abstract = {Previously proposed quantum algorithms for solving linear systems of equations cannot be implemented in the near term due to the required circuit depth. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, called Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS), for solving linear systems on near-term quantum computers. VQLS seeks to variationally prepare \${\textbar}x{\textbackslash}rangle\$ such that \$A{\textbar}x{\textbackslash}rangle{\textbackslash}propto{\textbar}b{\textbackslash}rangle\$. We derive an operationally meaningful termination condition for VQLS that allows one to guarantee that a desired solution precision \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ is achieved. Specifically, we prove that \$C {\textbackslash}geq {\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}2 / {\textbackslash}kappa{\textasciicircum}2\$, where \$C\$ is the VQLS cost function and \${\textbackslash}kappa\$ is the condition number of \$A\$. We present efficient quantum circuits to estimate \$C\$, while providing evidence for the classical hardness of its estimation. Using Rigetti's quantum computer, we successfully implement VQLS up to a problem size of \$1024{\textbackslash}times1024\$. Finally, we numerically solve non-trivial problems of size up to \$2{\textasciicircum}\{50\}{\textbackslash}times2{\textasciicircum}\{50\}\$. For the specific examples that we consider, we heuristically find that the time complexity of VQLS scales efficiently in \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$, \${\textbackslash}kappa\$, and the system size \$N\$.},

	abstract = {Solving linear systems of equations is essential for many problems in science and technology, including problems in machine learning. Existing quantum algorithms have demonstrated the potential for large speedups, but the required quantum resources are not immediately available on near-term quantum devices. In this work, we study near-term quantum algorithms for linear systems of equations, with a focus on the two-norm and Tikhonov regression settings. We investigate the use of variational algorithms and analyze their optimization landscapes. There exist types of linear systems for which variational algorithms designed to avoid barren plateaus, such as properly-initialized imaginary time evolution and adiabatic-inspired optimization, suffer from a different plateau problem. To circumvent this issue, we design near-term algorithms based on a core idea: the classical combination of variational quantum states (CQS). We exhibit several provable guarantees for these algorithms, supported by the representation of the linear system on a so-called ansatz tree. The CQS approach and the ansatz tree also admit the systematic application of heuristic approaches, including a gradient-based search. We have conducted numerical experiments solving linear systems as large as 2300 × 2300 by considering cases where we can simulate the quantum algorithm efficiently on a classical computer. Our methods may provide benefits for solving linear systems within the reach of near-term quantum devices.},

In this article, we focus on derivative pricing based on solving the Black–Scholes partial differential equation by the finite-difference method (FDM), which is a suitable approach for some types of derivatives but suffers from the curse of dimensionality, that is, exponential growth of complexity in the case of multiple underlying assets. We propose a quantum algorithm for FDM-based pricing of multi-asset derivative with exponential speedup with respect to dimensionality compared with classical algorithms. The proposed algorithm utilizes the quantum algorithm for solving differential equations, which is based on quantum linear system algorithms. Addressing the specific issue in derivative pricing, that is, extracting the derivative price for the present underlying asset prices from the output state of the quantum algorithm, we present the whole of the calculation process and estimate its complexity. We believe that the proposed method opens the new possibility of accurate and high-speed derivative pricing by quantum computers.},

  abstract = {A reformulation of Maxwell equations for an inhomogeneous, anisotropic, passive and non-dispersive medium results in a quantum-like Schrodinger equation that admits unitary time evolution. In contrast to other approaches, there is no a-priori introduction of the Riemann-Silberstein-Weber (RSW) vector but the Maxwell equations are considered in their standard fields, with given constitutive relations. From the electromagnetic conservation quantities a pseudo-Hermitian dynamics is found together with a Dyson map that recovers the full Hermicity of the dynamics in an extended Hilbert space that describes the physical notion of unitary evolution. As an example, a uniaxial tensor dielectric medium is considered, with the explicit Dyson map yielding an optimal representation in a set of generalized RSW vectors. In this newly discovered form, a Quantum Computing (QC) implementation for simulation of electromagnetic wave propagation in complex media can be made, with further extension into plasmas.},

  abstract = {There is considerable interest in the application of quantum information science to advance computations in plasma physics. A particular point~of curiosity is whether it is possible to take advantage of quantum computers to speed up numerical simulations relative to conventional computers. Many of the topics in fusion plasma physics are classical in nature. In order to implement them on quantum computers, it will require couching a classical problem in the language of quantum mechanics. Electromagnetic waves are routinely used in fusion experiments to heat a plasma or to generate currents in the plasma. The propagation of electromagnetic waves is described by Maxwell equations with an appropriate description of the plasma as a dielectric medium. Before advancing to the tensor dielectric of a magnetized plasma, this paper considers electromagnetic wave propagation in a one-dimensional inhomogeneous scalar dielectric. The classic theory of scattering of plane electromagnetic waves at a planar interface, separating two different dielectric media, leads to Fresnel equations for reflection and transmission coefficients. In contrast to plane waves, this paper is on the reflection and transmission of a spatially confined electromagnetic pulse. Following an analytical formulation for the scattering of a Gaussian pulse, it is deduced that the maximum transmission coefficient for a pulse is  {$\mathsl{n}$} 2 / {$\mathsl{n}$} 1 - - - - - {$\surd$} n2/n1  times that for a plane wave; the incident and transmitted pulses propagate in dielectric media with refractive indices n1 and n2, respectively. The analytical theory is complemented by numerical simulations using a quantum lattice algorithm for Maxwell equations. The algorithm, based on the Riemann\textendash Silberstein\textendash Weber representation of the electromagnetic fields and expressed in terms of qubits, is an interleaved sequence of entangling operators at each lattice site and unitary streaming operators, which transmit information from one site to an adjacent lattice site. Besides substantiating results from the theory for Gaussian pulses, numerical simulations show their validity for non-Gaussian pulses. Apart from their time-asymptotic forms, the simulations display an interplay between the incident, reflected, and transmitted pulses in the vicinity of the transition region between two dielectric media.}

The electromagnetic fields are discretized using a 16-qubit representation at each grid point. The discretized QLA equations reproduce Maxwell equations to second order in an appropriate expansion parameter {$\epsilon$} . The properties of scattered waves depend on the scale length of the transition layer separating the vacuum from the core of the dielectric.

A second-order accurate 4-spinor scheme is developed and tested successfully for two-dimensional (2-D) propagation of a Gaussian pulse in a uniform medium whereas for normal (1-D) incidence of an electromagnetic Gaussian wave packet onto a dielectric interface requires 8-component spinors because of the coupling between the two electromagnetic polarizations.

The QLA simulations yield the time-dependent electromagnetic fields as the wave packet enters and straddles the dielectric boundary.

The quantum lattice gas algorithm correctly accounts for the anticommutative braiding of indistinguishable fermions|it does not suffer the Fermi-sign problem. It provides a highly convergent numerical simulation for strongly-correlated fermions equal to a covariant path integral, presented here for the case when a Dirac particle's Compton wavelength is large compared to the grid scale of the qubit array.}

  abstract = {Using a set of interleaved unitary collision-stream operators, a three-dimensional (3D) quantum lattice gas algorithm is devised which, on taking moments, recovers the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation. If a zero-temperature Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is trapped in an a magnetic well, the evolution of the ground-state wave function satisfies the scalar GP equation, while if the BEC is trapped in an optical trap the ground-state wave function satisfies spin or GP equations. Quantum turbulence is studied in a scalar GP system on 5,7603 grid yielding not only the classical Kolmogorov k-5/3 cascade but also the quantum vortex k-3 spectrum. For a certain class of initial conditions, one finds an intermittent loss of tangled quantum vortices as the vortex cores attain minimal size, and thus prevent the Kelvin wave cascade (due to helical wave-wave coupling on the vortex). A coupled set of GP equations are solved for spin or BEC. Skrymions, which describe topologically-linked quantum vortices, are examined. One finds, for certain initial conditions that the incompressible kinetic energy spectrum for the condensate component of a vortex ring core rapidly departs from the k-3 linear quantum vortex spectrum.},

  abstract = {A unitary qubit lattice algorithm, which scales almost perfectly to the full number of cores available (e.g., 216000 cores on a CRAY XT5), is used to examine quantum turbulence and its interrelationship to classical turbulence with production runs on grids up to 57603. The maximal grids achievable by conventional CFD for quantum turbulence is just 20483, and artificial dissipation had to be introduced. Our unitary algorithms preserve the Hamiltonian structure of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation which describes quantum turbulence in a zero-temperature Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). As a result, parameter regimes have been uncovered which exhibit very short Poincare recurrence time, as well as a strong triple cascade structure in the kinetic energy spectrum. Moreover, a detailed examination of the incompressible kinetic energy spectrum has revealed for the first time within a turbulence simulation the k-17/5 quantum Kelvin wave cascade. By generalizing the unitary entanglement operators on the 2 qubits, a finite temperature BEC system is examined. These unitary qubit lattice algorithms are directly applicable to quantum computers as they become available.},

  abstract = {\$\textbackslash bf\{Abstract\}\$: A qubit lattice algorithm (QLA), which consists of a set of interleaved unitary collision-streaming operators, is developed for electromagnetic wave propagation in tensor dielectric media. External potential operators are required to handle gradients in the refractive indices, and these operators are typically non-unitary. A similar problem arises in the QLA for the Korteweg-de Vries equation, as the potential operator that models the KdV nonlinear term is also non-unitary. Several QLAs are presented here that avoid the need of this non-unitary potential operator by perturbing the collision operator. These QLAs are fully unitary.},
